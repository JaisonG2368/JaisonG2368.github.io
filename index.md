# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 6, part 1
Lab 6 was the first lab that incorporated vectors, which was a fun tool to make a sandwich. It was pretty hard to wrap my mind around that 0 equals 1 but in the end. I got used to it and was able to make a sandwich with all sorts of proteins breads, and condiments.

Lab 1, Part 1 
This lab was the first lab that got the wheels on the bus spinning. It was quite a simple lab that just had us open a code and edit it with the words “Hello world”. This lab was very useful in also teaching me and my peers how to use commands to turn in our work as well.

Lab 12, part 1
This was one of my favorite labs since it marked the end of my first college semester. It was quite a long assignment to code, but with all my prior knowledge from the other assignments I was able to knock it out. Plus it was fun to code a gif and make it move left to right, or right to left.
